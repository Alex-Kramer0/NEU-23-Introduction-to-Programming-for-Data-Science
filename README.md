# Introduction to Programming for Data Science

## Overview
The course is a hands-on introduction to the fundamentals of programming, data structures and algorithms for data sciences. The course encompasses programming basics such as functions, data structures, and algorithms; and their use in design and implementation of data science applications. Fundamentals of discrete mathematics for programming with data will be introduced where appropriate. The course will also introduce students to programming as a collaborative discipline. The course will develop programming experience in Python.

Students are required to get a B or above in the placement courses in order to progress into the core courses in the degree program. Students that do not achieve a B or better in the placement courses will be required to retake the courses.

## Topics
- Control flow and program logic
- Data types (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets)
- Data structures (arrays, queues, stacks, hash tables, trees, etc.)
- Computational complexity
- Files and I/O
- Object-oriented programming
- Number systems and representation (binary, hex, floating point)
- Programming with vectors, arrays, and matrices
- Source control and version control systems
- Unit testing

## Project: Card-Shark
Card-Shark is a simple deck constructor Python package that allows developers to easily create and manage decks and cards without having to worry about basic functions. This package will allow you to focus on implmenting game-specific rules and mechanics.

Card-Shark was created as a final project for Introduction to Programming for Data Science course at Northeastern taught by Kylie Bemis. Throughout creating this package we learned to implement class concepts such as linked lists, testing, github and overall coding collaboration.
