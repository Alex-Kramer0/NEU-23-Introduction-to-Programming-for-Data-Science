# Introduction to Programming for Data Science

## Overview
The course is a hands-on introduction to the fundamentals of programming, data structures and algorithms for data sciences. The course encompasses programming basics such as functions, data structures, and algorithms; and their use in design and implementation of data science applications. Fundamentals of discrete mathematics for programming with data will be introduced where appropriate. The course will also introduce students to programming as a collaborative discipline. The course will develop programming experience in Python.

Students are required to get a B or above in the placement courses in order to progress into the core courses in the degree program. Students that do not achieve a B or better in the placement courses will be required to retake the courses.
